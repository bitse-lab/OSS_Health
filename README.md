# OSS Health Reporter

**OSS Health Reporter** is a system designed to evaluate the health of Open Source Software (OSS) projects. The system integrates multi-dimensional metrics across three dimensions: software, community, and market. It determines the weight of each metric using the entropy weight method and calculates comprehensive health scores using a GPA aggregation model. The newly added **Health Report Generation Module** can automatically produce actionable health reports based on key metrics, providing decision-making support for project managers and developers.

## Module Description

### 1. Backend (Spring Boot)
- Directory: `src/main/java`
- Responsibilities:
  - **Data Collection:** Fetch project metrics from GitHub and SonarQube.
  - **Metric Processing:** Calculate metric weights using the entropy weight method and compute health scores for each metric and dimension.
  - **API Provision:** Expose RESTful APIs to support frontend visualization and the Health Report Generation module.

### 2. Health Report Generation Module (Python)
- Directory: `src/main/python`
- Responsibilities:
  - Generate standardized health reports based on key metric time-series data.

### 3. Frontend (Vue.js)
- Directory: `src/main/resources/static/oss-health`
- Responsibilities:
  - Display project health through an interactive dashboard.
  - Support radar charts, time-series charts, and other interactive visualizations.

### 4. Testing
- Directory: `src/test/java/com/OSS/Health`
- Responsibilities:
  - Unit and integration testing of the backend.
  - Verify the correctness of data collection, metric calculation, and API responses.

### 5. Example Results
- Directory: `resources/cann_analysis_reports`
- Content:
  - Sample health reports generated by the system.
  - Useful for reference on output format and metric presentation.
